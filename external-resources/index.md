## Integrations

Spring Contract Verifier (previously called Accurest) is a consumer driven contracts tool that generates WireMock stub mappings as
examples for client testing.

## Extensions

Some folks at Open Table have written a response transformer for injecting data from the
request body into the response:<br>

In a similar vein, Adam York has written a response transformer utilising Velocity templates:<br>

## Articles

Sam Edwards has been hugely helpful in getting WireMock onto the Android platform and helping others do so. Here is his blog post explaining
how to write an Espresso testing using WireMock as your app's back-end:

Chris Batey did an excellent talk at Skillsmatter in London about building fault tolerant microservices. He showed some practical
failure testing strategies using WireMock and Saboteur he'd used for real while working at Sky:<br>

Daniel Bryant's excellent QCon presentation "The Seven Deadly Sins of Microservices" covers the full gamut of microservice anti-patterns seen in the wild, with some sound advice on how to fix them. WireMock and Saboteur get an honourable mention in the testing discussion:<br>

The folks at Intuit have built a very impressive and ambitious testing setup, using WireMock to isolate individual services. Here's a talk they did at AWS:Reinvent:<br>

Michael Bailey was the first person to publicly demonstrate the possibility of running WireMock on Android. Here's his presentation at Google's GTAC conference on
the testing setup used by his team at Amex:<br>
